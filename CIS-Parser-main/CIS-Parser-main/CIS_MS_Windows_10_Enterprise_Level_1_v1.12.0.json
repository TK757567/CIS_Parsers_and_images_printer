Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.\n\nImpact:\n\nIf an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the password until the next day."], "type": ["PASSWORD_POLICY"], "reference": ["CSCv7|16.10,CSCv8|5.2,LEVEL|1A"], "see_also": ["https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/3719"], "value_type": ["TIME_DAY"], "value_data": ["[1..4294967295]"], "password_policy": ["acl_apply"], "solution": ["To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 1 or more day(s):\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy\\Minimum password age\n\nDefault Value:\n\n1 day on domain members. 0 days on stand-alone workstations."]}, "ids": {"control": "63f90172b5c55c3ac355439ab2742f5e39a4a21ccce4c73aa7f440d5d2db21dd", "informational": "25a30edc2be5618f91c65918957a0cf973a289f3de1226ca384f16554bb9d6a0", "functional": "94868f1117", "full": "2cdd762d4359ead611801220e6491f8bf31e99e1383fbddce06b15428d778358", "compliance": "2cdd762d4359ead611801220e6491f8bf31e99e1383fbddce06b15428d778358"}}, {"item_type": "custom", "contents": {"description": ["1.1.4 Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)'"], "info": ["This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps 'passphrase' is a better term than 'password.' In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as 'I want to drink a $5 milkshake' is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).\n\nNote: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.\n\nNote #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior.

Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.\n\nImpact:\n\nRequirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls.

This fifth category can be regionally specific.\n\nEach additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords.

However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.\n\nIf your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments.\n\nAlso, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range.

Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.\n\nThe risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:\n\nAll client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner.\n\nAll Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.\n\nAll PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner.\n\nThe PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.\n\nThis vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.\n\nImpact:\n\nThere should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not belong to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source."], "type": ["USER_RIGHTS_POLICY"], "reference": ["LEVEL|1A"], "see_also": ["https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/3719"], "value_type": ["USER_RIGHT"], "value_data": ["'Administrators' && 'LOCAL SERVICE'"], "solution": ["To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE:\n\nComputer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\User Rights Assignment\\Change the system time\n\nDefault Value:\n\nAdministrators, LOCAL SERVICE."], "right_type": ["SeSystemTimePrivilege"]}, "ids": {"control": "b5e6f0604ebe65a97d820ca2d3cfda6ab706e472c0cf7ccd234ffce9cf72a715", "informational": "cf2a79ed2a37a4441554f565893cf0c860e97f6149dc11a7643be90b3129c872", "functional": "734942d622", "full": "78fc1991f64d03e9d16f65b2588c70cda896c298c0c5685cb7b498972f8c1e1f", "compliance": "78fc1991f64d03e9d16f65b2588c70cda896c298c0c5685cb7b498972f8c1e1f"}}, {"item_type": "custom", "contents": {"description": ["2.2.9 Ensure 'Change the time zone' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, Users'"], "info": ["This setting determines which users can change the time zone of the computer.

Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords.

Refuse LM & NTLM'"], "info": ["LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:\n\nJoin a domain\n\nAuthenticate between Active Directory forests\n\nAuthenticate to down-level domains\n\nAuthenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP\n\nAuthenticate to computers that are not in the domain\n\nThe Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.\n\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM.\n\nRationale:\n\nWindows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.\n\nThe Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible.\n\nImpact:\n\nClients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM."], "reg_option": ["group_type"], "type": ["REGISTRY_SETTING"], "reference": ["CSCv7|9.2,CSCv8|3.10,LEVEL|1A"], "reg_key": ["HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa"], "reg_item": ["LMCompatibilityLevel"], "see_also": ["https://workbench.cisecurity.org/files/3719"], "value_type": ["POLICY_DWORD"], "value_data": ["5"], "solution": ["To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Send NTLMv2 response only.

The Require DoH option could also lead to domain-joined systems not functioning properly within the environment.\n\nThe option Enabled: Allow DoH will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers support it. If they don't support it, classic name resolution will be used.
